# Create some lists
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = [1, "string value", True]

# A list can contain different types of values, which list3 is an example of

# Accessing element at an index:
element = list3[1]
print(element)

# Lists are "zero indexed". This means the first element is located at index 0
print(list3[0])

# Iterate over all items in a list using a for loop: (you've already seen this in loop.py: The function range(x) returns a list)
for elem in list2:
    print(elem)

# More information about lists: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists

# Try to create a list with the items -> 1, 2, "Foo", False, 3.5




# Print the number of items in the list (look at the link given above or by all means google it, everything is googleable, especially when it comes to programming)




# Reverse the list, then access and print the last element in the list.
